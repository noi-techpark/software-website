Generate images with the Stable Diffusion Machine Learning Algorithm by entering a text. The image is generated on the fly by the AI.
It was released 2022 by the Startup [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release). Stable Diffusion is very good at copying art-styles, so prompting for "watercolor" or "magazine photo" or "illustration"
is a good idea. Generally one needs to generate a few images to find an appealing one.  
The source code is released as Open Source Software under the "CreativeML Open RAIL-M" License and is available on Github [https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)  
The Training Model is available on Huggingface [https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original)
