This 2-day workshop will lay the foundation for your customer-centric product or service development. On day one we will interview customers to get insights into their needs and motivations when using your product or service. Day two serves to synthesize all the insights you have gotten from potential users in order to identify what features customers really need, value and pay for. All insights are synthesized in a customer needs canvas, which is your perfect starting kit into a customer-centric, and thus sustainable, innovation process.
